<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>Pizza Palace aims to provide pizza of the highest quality to every
pizza lover out there. Here, we treat every order with like our own and work
hard to perfect your pizza.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Pizza Palace started out in the early 200s as a local family owned pizzeria in Queens.
When the rent got too high, the owner was about to give up on the business.
With the help of his heroic daughter and some amazing pizza lovers, Pizza Palace 
has officially reopened in its cherished home state, right here in the heart of
New York City.</p>

<h3>Come Visit</h3>
<p>Stop by any of our locations to grab the best pizza you'll ever have!
We are now up and running at West Maple Drive, NYC and will soon be
opening in Long Island City and East Flatbush.
We're open Monday to Saturday from 10:30 AM till Midnight.</p>
